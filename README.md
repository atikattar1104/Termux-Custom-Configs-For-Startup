# Termux-Custom-Configs-For-Startup
Here Is The Custom Configs For Termux's Custom Startup Screen.

# Requirements :- 
> 1. An Up-To-Date Termux.
> 2. `NeoFetch` And `CPUFetch` Packages Installed.
> 3. Knowledge Of Directory Commands And Their Syntax.

# Setup :- 
Step 1 :- Download All Files Except `README.md` From `Code` Section Of This Page.

Step 2 :- Move Files That Starts With `termux-custom-` To `usr/etc/`, Which Is Outside Of `home` Directory.

Step 3 :- Move Files That Starts With `neofetch-` To `.termux/.config/neofetch/`, Which Is Inside Of `home` Directory.

Step 4 :- Remove `termux-custom-` And `neofetch-` From File Names.

Note :- If Files Already Exists With Same Name, Make Sure Not To Delete Them. Instead, Change Their Name (E.g. :- If `motd` Exists, Change It To `old_motd` Or Something Like That.). In Case, Customization Gives Errors, These Old Files Might Be Helpful.
