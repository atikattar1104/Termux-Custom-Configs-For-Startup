# Setup :- 

Step 1 :- Download All Files Except `README.md` From `Code` Section Of This Page.

Step 2 :- Run Termux Once, If Never Used Before.

Step 3 :- Go To `usr/etc/` Folder, Which Is Outside Of `home` Directory, Using `cd .. ; cd usr/etc/` Command.

Step 4 :- Rename `bash.bashrc` File To `old-bash.bashrc` And `motd` File To `old-motd`. Useful In Case Customization Gives Errors.

Step 5 :- Create New Files Named `bash.bashrc` And `motd` In `usr/etc/` Folder, Which Is Outside Of `home` Directory, And Copy All Content Of Downloaded `bash.bashrc` And `motd` Files To The Newly Created `bash.bashrc` And `motd` File.

Step 6 :- Run `neofetch` and `cpufetch` Commands At Once, If Never Used Before.

Step 7 :- Go To `.config/neofetch/` Folder, Which Is Inside Of `home` Directory, Using `cd .config/neofetch/` Command.
